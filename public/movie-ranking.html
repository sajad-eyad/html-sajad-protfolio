<h1>The Best Movie According Sajad</h1>
<h2>my top movie of all-time </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Five Feet A part</h3>
<p>A romantic drama movie, one of the best movies I have seen in my life in terms of drama and romance.</p>
<h3>Fury</h3>
<p>One of the best war movies I have ever seen.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<P>I watched it in the cinema and it was one of the most beautiful films that talked about the character of Oppenheimer and physics. It was not overwhelmed by dialogues and knowledge, and I do not exclude the effects.</P>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<P>One of the best films for me i liked the plot of the film, which talks about the vast space and touches on the past, present, future and changing conditions.</P>
